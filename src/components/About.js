        Hello, I am Esmeralda Gonzalez-Rojo. I am currently in Pursuit as a
        fellow in the 9.5 cohort learning to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
        I am pursuing software engineering because I enjoy being creative and
        utilizing my problem-solving and analytical skills. Some of my key
        strengths are that I am an eager learner and meticulous, and my thought
        process can be methodical. I am passionate about expanding my knowledge,
        especially in coding and creating games or websites for easier everyday
        life. Some of my hobbies outside of coding include cooking. Cooking, for
        me, is just like coding. I love trying new recipes every once in a while
        and also finding ways to improve my current recipes.

        Hello! I'm Karma Ghale, a student at Pursuit, a non-profit organization
        that offers a year-long software development/engineering bootcamp. My
        goal is to work in the tech industry as a software engineer or
        developer. I have always been fascinated by the potential of technology,
        and pursuing software engineering allows me to channel that interest
        into creating innovative solutions that can make a real difference in
        people's lives. With fluency in English, Nepali, and Hindi, I possess
        coding skills in C++, JavaScript, and Python.One of my standout
        qualities is my ability to collaborate and work effectively with people
        from diverse backgrounds. I strongly believe that being able to thrive
        in a diverse workforce is crucial for bringing in a wide range of
        talents and unique perspectives, which ultimately leads to innovation
        and creativity in the competitive business world. Beside coding, I enjoy
        spending my free time hiking, skiing and getting lost in nature, and I
        am also an avid soccer fan.
